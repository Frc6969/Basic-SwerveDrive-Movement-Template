# Basic-SwerveDrive-Movement-Template

Welcome to team 6969's Basic SwerveDrive Movement Template!

The code can be openened right in VSCode (Best to use the wpilib version)

Basic Setup:
  1. After importing the project ensure that you have YAGSL and all of its dependencies installed
  2. Fix any compatability issues caused by future seasons updates
  3. Use https://docs.yagsl.com/configuring-yagsl/configuration to edit your config files to work with your swervedrive
  3.5 YOUR GEAR RATIO HAS TO BE EXACTLY CORRECT OR IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
  4. Have fun

Actually driving the robot
  - There are many ways the robot can be controlled!
  - The 'ZachControls.java' class uses my prefered way of moving the robot joysticks, triggers, and buttons
  - You can keep using this class or make your own (better idea as mine is quite inefficient)
